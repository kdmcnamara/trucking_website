                Before you can drive at all you need to learn how to drive a semi and obtain a Commercial Driver's License (CDL).
                Truck driver schools teach you what you need to know to pass the CDL tests. The average cost is $1,500 to $3,500 but some
                companies pay for training if the student agrees to work for them for a year.

                Semi autonoumous trucks are becoming a reality but still require someone to sit in the cab in case of bad weather or unexpected conditions.
                You have always wanted to try out dispatching and now you can do that from the driver's seat of your truck.
                However you are missing home and decide that you would prefer to go back home and become a local driver, delivering goods from transfer hubs
                to their final destinations.

        <h3>Truck Drivers Run America</h3>
        <p>
          Our country is constantly growing and somehow we have been doing a good job keeping up with it.
          As the country grows, more is needed.
          More goods, materials, resources, you name it.
          With this rapid growth and the consistent high demand for goods, how do we keep up with it?
          It doesn’t magically happen on it’s own.
          The answer is truck drivers.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Transportation</b></h4>
        <p>
          Without truck drivers, the movement of consumer goods would be extremely limited.
          Did you know that 80% of consumer goods are transported by trucks?
          The trucking industry is a vital part of our economy that most Americans take for granted.
          Think about what you do, use, and eat on a daily basis.
          Chances are most of those things have been loaded in and loaded out of a truck.
          Most people do not realize how different their lives would be without this industry.
        </p>
        <h4><b>Economic Collapse</b></h4>
        <p>
          Trucks help your companies grow and move at a steady pace as well as the whole nation.
          Without the help of truck drivers, you can say goodbye to globalization.
          The American economy and other economies around the world would be completely destroyed with nothing to move the imports and exports.
          Major manufacturers would have to shut down leaving thousands of people without jobs.
          If the trucking industry shut down, gas stations would soon run out of fuel, grocery stores would run low on food,
          and hospitals would not have access to medicine they need in order to save lives and give people the gift of having their loved ones alive and healthy.
          This is not the pretty picture we would like to see, but, it is the true reality of the way we would live without truck drivers help.
          Trucking makes the world a healthier, cleaner, and better place to live and we truly could not survive without them.

        <br><br>
        <h4><b>MAKE A DIFFERENCE</b></h4>
        <p>
          America relies on the trucking industry and <b>America needs drivers.</b>
          Open the doors to your future today and help not only make a positive change in this world but steer us away from the scary reality we could face.

                This soon may change to allow anyone with a CDL drive across state lines even if they are under 21.
                A bill was introduced in March to lower the interstate driving age to 18 as long as driver pass the correct tests to get a CDL.

                Truck driving is a great option for people with free time on their hands and looking for an extra source of income.
                There is a lot of flexibility in trucking and it would be a good inflow of cash for those who aren’t currently financially satisfied.
                Trucking is also a very realistic job for people among the retired population.
                Whether you had planned to work for supplementary funds or not, this industry can do anything from helping you stay on your feet

                Electric trucks are already in the market, but they are not quite at the capabilities for the transport industry to fully embrace them.
                Currently, about 100 mile range electric trucks are already in the market.
                Tesla unveiled their electric truck in November of 2017, with the promise of a 500 mile range before recharging.
                They say production will start in 2019, and if their claim of 500 miles is accurate, it will revolutionize the trucking industry.
                Speculation and skepticism are rampant about the Tesla trucks, but even 60% of the promised 500 miles would be a huge improvement when a majority of freight moves less than 250 miles.
                Other electric options have been announced or unveiled as well. Daimler, out of Germany,
                has unveiled a 250 mile range electric truck which it plans to have out in early access customers hands by the end of 2018, with volume production planned for 2021.
                Nikola Motor Company unveiled a hydrogen-electric truck with claims of being able to travel 1,200 miles on a tank of hydrogen. These are supposed to be market ready by 2020.
                The future of electric trucks is bright and they will be leading the world into the future of electric vehicles.

                Platooning is a strategy implemented by companies to electronically link trucks up one after another.
                This way while driving on the highway, the trucks travel at the same speed and also break at the same time so they are always close behind one another.
                This allows the following trucks to use a lot less fuel, saving on CO2 emissions.
                All of these trucks still need drivers in them, therefore, this optimization of fuel use has no impact on the job market.

                Video intelligence is a near 360 degree view of what is happening outside of the truck through mounted cameras.
                This video feed will record based on certain trigger events to capture what really happens in the case of an accident.
                This is to protect the driver from wrongful accusations as truck drivers are usually just assumed to be the ones at fault of an accident.
                Video intelligence makes sure that the truck driver will not be falsely blamed, which protects not only the driver, but the company.
                This is a shift of thinking in the industry; before, cameras were being mounted in the cab to watch the trucker’s driving but now it’s watching the actual event.
                Video intelligence also pairs with vehicle engine data to provide safety analytics.

                Autonomous trucks are the future of the transportation industry.
                However, while some experts say it’s 10 years down the road, others say its 30 and some say full autonomy won’t ever happen.
                In any case, autonomy in some form is the future of trucking. What does this mean for truck drivers?
                A popular model for self-driving trucks is the transfer hub model.
                The transfer hub model would have autonomous trucks driving long haul routes between transfer hubs, and human drivers driving locally between the destination and the transfer hub.
                A study done by Uber on the transfer hub model for self-driving trucks saw an increase in jobs for truck drivers, but on a more local level so that drivers can spend more time at home.
                A swedish company, Einride, is removing the cab of the truck,
                having the truck drive itself for the long haul routes and having truck drivers drive remotely when they get close to the final destination.
                Automation is the future of the trucking industry, though in what form exactly is still unknown. In any case, jobs for truck drivers will not be going away anytime soon.

                    Truckers are a brotherhood -- We're largely in competition with each other,
                    but I can remember very few instances where I've had a confrontation with another driver,
                    or another driver was rude to me. It's the opposite; when you walk into a truck stop lounge
                    or sit at the Driver's Only section of an Iron Skillet, drivers chat and joke as though
                    they've known each other for years. Drivers who are military vets seem to bond especially fast.

                    The media is always out to make this industry look horrible. For instance, there may be a bad accident that gets media coverage.
                    Immediately, the blame goes right to the semi. The very cause of the accident could have been from the other vehicle involved while they were texting and driving.

                        Most carriers require immediate drug and alcohol testing prior to hiring as well as random testing throughout their company.
                        The truckers that do use drugs or alcohol often do so to fight the sleepiness or solitude they may experience, as well as to induce their ability to work more.
                        New technology such as Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs)  and On-Board Computers (OBCs) restrict drivers to only driving 11 hours a day as well as allowing them to connect with their family back home.
                        This behavior isn’t more prevalent in trucking more than other industries.
